## How was my Tweets received?

### Motivation

- Building reputations for the profession is important to me.
- For online presence, Twitter is one of the great channels.
- I want to learn the characteristics of influential Tweets!

## How do I do that?

*** =left

- In 2014, I tweeted `r nrow(dataRaw)` times.
- Each has metrics such as:
    - *Impressions*: the number of users who saw the tweet
    - *Engagements*: the number of user's actions such as retweets, replies,
      link clicks, profile clicks, and etc.

Let's visualize taking date and impressions as X and Y axes, respectively.
(I also colored English and Japanese tweets differntly)

*** =right

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(data=data, aes(x=date, y=impressions, col=lang)) + geom_point()
```

## What about engagements?

*** =left

We can visualize as the size of the point.

This is called *bubble chart*.

*** =right

```{r, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, cache=FALSE}
ggplot(data=data, aes(x=date, y=impressions, col=lang, size=engagements)) +
    geom_point()
```

--- &twocol

## I want to see the actual tweets along the chart!

*** =left

- Now the chart needs to be interactive to reveal details of the data including
the content of the tweets.
- So, I built an app that has a slide bar to choose the months to display
all the tweets in the month along with the chart.
- Please try out the app at:
